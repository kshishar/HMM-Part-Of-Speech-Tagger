# HMM-Part-Of-Speech-Tagger
This notebook uses the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a Hidden Markov Model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf). 

This is a project from Udacity's NLP Nanodegree where I built and trained the model to predict parts of speech labels for each word in the input sentence.
I contributed the key architectural components for the model (marked under #TODO lines), while Udacity provided the remaining code.

NOTE: If you are prompted to select a kernel when you launch a notebook, choose the Python 3kernel.
